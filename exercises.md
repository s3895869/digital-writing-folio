## Week 1

**What do you think digital writing is?**

Digital writing is literature that takes advantage of and uses elements from technology, the internet and programming language. It's a modern hybridised form that pulls from both traditional literature and contemporary media.

**What do you expect from the digital writing lab?**

I'm expecting to learn about the depths of this form and the creative techniques writers have used in this space. 

**What type of writing do you do?**

Mainly screenwriting and poetry.

**What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?**

I use screenwriting software for writing screenplays and Word for poetry. 

**Why do you use these tools?**

Screenwriting software automatically formats my piece according to industry standards, it saves me time and energy not having to worry about the minute structure and instead focus on the writing. As for poetry, word is sufficient as the formatting is a creative choice and varies depending on the poem.

**How do these tools shape the way you write?**

Familiarity with software makes approaching the writing more streamlined, but it also has it's limitations, especially when it comes to hybridised forms. Both Final Draft and Word don't lend themselves to incoporating images or video so I'd say that would be a limitation.

**Electronic Literature Collection**

It was interesting to see the variation in writing within the collection, and the incoporation of technology was fascinating. I'm particularly interested in digital poetry and have played around with many of the different poetic works. One that has stood out to me is Yardley, PA 1997 with it's interactivity and audio-visual atmosphere.
