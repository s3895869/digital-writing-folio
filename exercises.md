## Week 1

**What do you think digital writing is?**

Digital writing is literature that takes advantage of and uses elements from technology, the internet and programming language. It's a modern hybridised form that pulls from both traditional literature and contemporary media.

**What do you expect from the digital writing lab?**

I'm expecting to learn about the depths of this form and the creative techniques writers have used in this space. 

**What type of writing do you do?**

Mainly screenwriting and poetry.

**What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?**

I use screenwriting software for writing screenplays and Word for poetry. 

**Why do you use these tools?**

Screenwriting software automatically formats my piece according to industry standards, it saves me time and energy not having to worry about the minute structure and instead focus on the writing. As for poetry, word is sufficient as the formatting is a creative choice and varies depending on the poem.

**How do these tools shape the way you write?**

Familiarity with software makes approaching the writing more streamlined, but it also has it's limitations, especially when it comes to hybridised forms. Both Final Draft and Word don't lend themselves to incoporating images or video so I'd say that would be a limitation.

**Electronic Literature Collection**

It was interesting to see the variation in writing within the collection, and the incoporation of technology was fascinating. I'm particularly interested in digital poetry and have played around with many of the different poetic works. One that has stood out to me is Yardley, PA 1997 with it's interactivity and audio-visual atmosphere.

## Week 3

**What elements of the works do you read?**

*Taroko Gorge*

The generative poetry. Every line is a selection of words taken from random collection. The poem then repeats itself with a different selection, a never-ending cycle of generated text.

*The Gathering Cloud*

A piece of visual poetry that blends basic text with hyperlinks and overlaying kinetc imagery. The website is split into distinct sections that each hold a self-contained poetic experience.

*First Draft of the Revolution*

Interactive fiction structured like letters sent between characters. The reader is given the option to change the letter, and proposes such changes.

*Shade*

Another piece of interactive fiction, this time structured more so like a mystery game. It seems to require a specific use of language to navigate your environment. It's written in second person and places the reader in an immersive experience where you search the space, unlock items, and make meaning out of the situation.

**How are those elements meaningful?**

*Taroko Gorge*

Generative poetry plays with the idea of extracted meaning, the way we can read a random sequence of words and make meaning out of it.

*The Gathering Cloud*

The visuals interact with the words that interact with the hyperlinks. It uses this blend of form to compliment or juxtapose the poetry.

*First Draft of the Revolution*

The ability to manipulate text, similar to the remix option in Taroko Gorge allows for an immersive audience interactivty.

*Shade*

Activates a deeper engagement with the text. The game elements give readers an objective based experience, progressing through the story only by unlocking certain sections.

**How are the works read differently from print literature?**

*Taroko Gorge*

This could be done with print, it would just be a painstakingly long process. The coded aspect makes the piece easier to create and access.

*The Gathering Cloud*

The kinetic imagery allows the creator to control pacing. With print literature, the creator loses that control and places it in the hands of the audience.

*First Draft of the Revolution*

The ability for the audience to manipulate the text to such extent can only be done with the technology of a digital space.

*Shade*

Similar to Taroko Gorge, this would be a long process and honestly break the immersion as the reader gets to see how much text there is, instead of working through section by section. In a format that is built on mystery, the less the audience has to work with, the more challenging and fun. It'd just be a messy experience in both creation and consumption.

**How is electronic literature different from print literature?**

Electronic literature is a hybridised form, blending in the written language of traditional literature with the modern language in contemporary media, such as cinema and gaming. Much like modern media, it is built and experience within the technology of the time, a translation into print text would be stripping some aspects of the text. 

**What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?**

Hybridisation, code, mechanics outside traditional writting.

### Algorithm and Constraints

**Lipograms**

An excerpt from *Dracula* written without the letter *e*.

I was not fully conscious, if I was in a fully conscious condition, I would spot an approach of such an amazing location. In night, a courtyard of colossal proportions guiding towards many dimly lit paths with round archways that look unfathomably big. It was a sight I had not caught sight of in daylight. 

  A coachman brought a cart to a halt, at which point said man would jump down and hold out his hand and I would grab it. Again I could not but catch sight of such prodigious brawn. His hands of such vigour, akin to iron clamps, could crush almost anything. At that point, my motorist laid down my traps in front as I stood with a big door, old and with big nails all across the rocky finish. Surprisingly, through a dim light I could still pick out many carvings that had worn down with maturity. As I stood, my coachman would mount his cart and start driving off, guiding his stallions through a dark gap.

**Mesostics**

Another excerpt, this time structured mesostically, spelling out the words *FADED* and *DRAPED*. 

See Coded version for the correct formatting.
